# U9-Network-Helper  
Personal/School project to simplify the configuration of Ubuntu 9.04.
## 🤔 Why?  
During the process of configuring an Ubuntu Server 9.04 network I realized that the process could be quite slow and susceptible to human error. In order to streamline as well as mitigate possible mistakes, I intend to make a bash script to help me (and hopefully other people) configure Ubuntu.  
Furthermore, I am focusing only on the old Ubuntu server and I have no plans to support other distros.  
## ⚙️ Current Features
- Ethernet Adapter Configuration Helper(WIP);
## 🚧 Planned Features:
- Automatically change sources.list so it uses old repositories instead;
- Automatically install dhcp3-package (I may add more network packages in the future...);
- DHCP configuration helper;
- *More features planned...*
